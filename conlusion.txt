CONCLUSION
1.Convolutional neural network is a learning method for data analysis and predictions, now days it also 
become very popular for image classification problems. Dog breed prediction of deep learning developed using 
convolutional neural network is to predict the breed of hundred images in taking their images as input.

2.Based on the literature review of five research papers we have proposed to use CNN method for our project by using bi-directional LSTM model.

3.Data set for the implementation of this project has been collected that includes 120 breeds of dogs where each image having a unique id to distinguish them.

4.The system architecture for building the android application has also been drafted that includes what feartured to be added like taking picture of dog,
uploading picture etc.

5.The future work includes the processing of dog images present in dataset for training the model and getting the appropriate accuracy.

6.The android application here acts as UI element for interaction between dog images and model.

7.Future work should further explore the potential ofconvolutional neural networks in dog breed prediction. 

8.Neural networks take an enormous time to train, so its recommended urther exploration into neural networks for keypoint detection, specifically
  by training networks with a different architecture and batch iterator to see what approaches might have greater success.

9. Ultimately, neural networks are time consuming to train and iterate upon, which should be kept in consideration for future efforts; still, 
   neural networks are formidable classifiers that will increase prediction accuracy over more traditional techniques.
